My website allows registered users to browse through approved books, borrow them for a duration of 3 weeks, and receive a confirmation email upon borrowing (with the email being a required field during registration). Users can view their borrowed books along with their due dates in a dedicated section. Users also have the ability to filter and search for books/authors on the homepage. Unregistered users have limited access, only to the login and registration pages.

Administrators have an extended version of the site, granting them the ability to perform all actions available to regular users. Additionally, admins can update book statuses (mark them as available, approved by admin, or modify their details). They have access to a special "management" panel that allows them to view lists of authors and book categories in the library, as well as a specific report on books that are not yet approved (facilitating easier review).
